<p>By default the box-plot chart sizes itself so that its width is the the setting <code>relativeWidth</code> (default-value 1) multiplied by the offset-width of its grandparent node in the HTML DOM. For some layouts this might give you the type of control you want. In that case you may direct <code>epexploder()</code> to make the width of the chart track the offset-width of an existing DOM element. For example, if paragraphs in your document have the desired width, then create an empty paragraph in your markdown like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p id="reference"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To set the widget-width to a specific fraction of the element that contains the paragraph, you could again use the <code>relativeWidth</code> setting, or you might try something like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p id="reference" style="width: 70%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p id="reference" style="width: 70%">
</p>
<p>in either case, call <code><a href="reference/bpexploder.html">bpexploder()</a></code> with the <code>referenceId</code> setting:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw"><a href="reference/bpexploder.html">bpexploder</a></span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> iris,

<li>Using the Leonids theme from the <code>prettydoc</code> R Markdown package, tool-tips are not visible in Firefox or Safari. (They do show in Chrome.)</li>
<li>The aspect-ratio of the svg-element is fixed at <span class="math display">\[\frac{\text{width}}{\text{height}} = \frac{5}{4}.\]</span>
</li>
<li>
<p>When <code><a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/htmlwidgets/topics/createWidget">htmlwidgets::createWidget()</a></code> creates a widget it gives the widget a random Id number. For some reason this can result in spurious warnings concerning the hidden variable <code>.Random.Seed</code>. To work around this, set a seed in the <code>setup</code> chunk of your R Markdown document, e.g.:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(bpexploder)
